      <li>Portfolio Website – I have created a personal portfolio website to showcase my academic journey, key skills, and various projects I’ve worked on. 
        It serves as a digital resume and a platform where I can highlight my growth in education and ICT, demonstrate my practical abilities, and share examples of my work. 
        The website reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for blending technology with teaching.</li>
    
      <li>Blogger – I maintain a simple blog where I share my thoughts, reflections, and insights related to my studies and experiences.
         It also features assignments and projects I’ve completed, giving readers a glimpse into my learning process and the knowledge I’m building.
          The blog is a space for me to practice writing, engage with ideas, and connect with others interested in education and technology.</li>
