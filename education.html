    <p>I’m currently studying for my Bachelor’s degree in Education, specializing in ICT in Education, at Samtse College of Education.
       It’s been an exciting journey so far, where I’m constantly learning new things and discovering how technology can really change the way we teach and learn.
        I’m passionate about using digital tools to make education more interesting and accessible for everyone. 
        Through this degree, I’m building the skills and knowledge I need to become a teacher who can bring fresh ideas into the classroom and help students succeed in a tech-driven world. 
        I’m really looking forward to turning this passion into a meaningful career.</p>
